### Project Description
**FocusFizz: Smart Break Buddy** is an interactive web app that boosts productivity through personalized, dynamic break prompts. It gently suggests fun mini-challenges, quirky facts, and short games to refresh your mind and keep focus engaging‚Äîperfect for balancing work with lighthearted breaks!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are *too productive* and rarely take fun, refreshing breaks during long work sessions. As a result, they miss out on spontaneous bursts of creativity, amusing trivia, and micro-challenges that could make workdays more enjoyable. FocusFizz solves the "problem" of overly serious work routines by introducing timely distractions to keep productivity fun and lively.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
FocusFizz swoops in with quirky breaks, mini-games, and random fun facts‚Äîperfectly timed to sneak a little fun into your workday. It's like having a personal assistant dedicated to keeping things interesting and making sure you don‚Äôt take productivity too seriously!
